I've used material UI for the UI of the website. I've kept it consistent throughout, with similar colours and sizes so there is an aspect of familiarity throughout the website. I've used white space throughout the website so that the cognitive load is reduced and the user can focus on the content. Everything is straightforwards and easy to use. The website is quite responsive and there is no lag. When using on slow internet, I've included loading for the content for more responsiveness on the user side.
